                h1 About Aliasr
                p(class='lead') Aliasr is an image upload pipelining tool for developers.
    div(class='row')
        div(class='col-sm-4')
            h3 What
            | Aliasr works like a url shortener, but with the ability to send the shortened link before a website is linked to it.
        div(class='col-sm-4')
            h3 Why
            | Integrating Aliasr in to your image sharing application allows your users to send links to images before they are even finished uploading.
        div(class='col-sm-4')
            h3 How
            | When you navigate to an Aliasr alias, your browser is redirected to the url associated with it. If there is no url associated yet, you will be shown a waiting page. As soon as the url is available, you will be redirected.
    div(class='row')
        h3 Before the image is ready
        p When someone opens an aliasr link to an image that has not finished uploading, they will be greeted with a loading page. As soon as your application informs aliasr of the image location, anyone viewing the loading page will be immediately redirected to the image.

            img(src='images/fast-click.png', class='img-preview')
    div(class='row')
        h3 After the image is ready
        p Once aliasr is aware of the image location, any future visits to the aliasr link will be immediately redirected to the image location.
